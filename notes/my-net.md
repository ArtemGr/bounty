## ideas around the “my net” toolbox

* Offline-first. The code (application, toolbox) should help me with networks (clients, developers, providers, products) even without the internet. The information I enter should be useful first and foremost to myself. That way, if I decide to share it, the information will be truthful and hence also the information I'm getting from others.  
(Compatible with [Syntropy](https://youtu.be/gSPNRu4ZPvE), the argoforestry metaphor?)

* Reuse. The code should add what's missing. If something is already implemented (job and bounty sites, markets, social networks) we should plug into the existing system, provide an added Value for them. For example, Upwork and GitHub already track the open source and private engagements, we can add combined statistics and graphics for them.

* Anonymous. If we share our notes or folksonomies, they should conflict not with our long-term engagements. [Outing a Munchausen can be a career ending move](https://youtu.be/UkMC_pz0eaM), for example. The code should allow us to share such information without such risks. On the other hand, there should be limits on spam and slander.  
Let's enumerate some possible conflicts.  
a) Truth versus reciprocity, biased towards positive.  
b) Truth versus scarcity, biased towards negative. J: “Say that a given company hires you and in fact they are really very satisfied with your work, price and personality. If the that company has a very competitive management, perhaps they would think giving you anonymous low rates would prevent you from being hired by a competitor or anyone else, therefore making you more readily available, perhaps even more affordable, to that company. Or the opposite, a developer finds a client so good that they would like to keep to themselves by anonymously trashing the client's image on the network.”  
c) Truth versus [Transference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transference), [Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Games_People_Play_(book)), biased at random. Something can [trigger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_trigger) a particularly subjective reaction.  
d) Truth versus culture, [biased towards negative](https://twitter.com/Artemciy/status/1331351201401737219).
