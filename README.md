Going to post new bounties at https://t.me/bounty_aga.  
If someone from a freelancing site (freelancer.com; fiverr.com; upwork.com; peopleperhour.com; etc) is then interested in the issue - we can create a dedicated freelance project/item for them.  
The ethics of [Forward Running Freelance](https://observablehq.com/@artemgr/forward-running-freelance) is preferred.
